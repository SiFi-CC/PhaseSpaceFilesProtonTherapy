README for SlicePhaseSpace
by Jonas Kasper

The Simulation is the HItfullSetup Geometry and PrimaryGun broken done to just the Wedges and the Slice. The output is a tree that contains all the seconadries that are produced within the Slice. The aim is to create a PhaseSpaceFile so that the Seconadries can be put into a PrimaryGun.
